# Giggle Bot
What is giggle bot?
Giggle bot is a slack bot that increases the humor levels of your slack chat room. It does this by reading trigger words from the slack channel through the slack api and returning a joke or a meme-ish picture (depending on the input).

## Automatic Deployment
This app has the ability to be deployed directly from Heroku.

First, you will need a slack token from slack.
To get this you must be part of a slack channel. You can create your own if you prefer.
Next visit: https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot to create a new bot.
You can name the bot whatever you want your giggle-bot to be called. Then  click `Add bot integration`.
Copy the displayed token.

This token will be used on Heroku for deployment and will be required when you click the deploy link below:

[![Deploy](https://www.Herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://Heroku.com/deploy)

enter the required data and deploy.

Finally, add the bot you created on slack to your channel via `/invite @giggle-bot`
